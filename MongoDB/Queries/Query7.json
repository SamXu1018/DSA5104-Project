      "host_about": "We are located Lower East Side (LES), the quintessential NYC neighborhood. If you’re looking to experience a part of New York City that is more eclectic, real and a little less touristy, then you’ve picked the right spot. The LES is situated in lower Manhattan - close to Soho and Chinatown and a short commute over to Brooklyn. It’s truly an area worth exploring; it draws a vibrant crowd and carries a cool and artistic vibe.\r\n\r\nFilled with a mix of historical tenement-style buildings, boutique stores, galleries, restaurants and amazing nightlife, you’ll enjoy spending the mornings taking in a great cup of coffee and the evenings dancing the night away. If you love music, food and drink and are looking for a fun urban adventure, then you’ll love this part of the city.",
